Title: U.S. Pollution

Team Members(Orange): Pragathi Madushinie, Dan Smart, John Sachs, Abiel Ogbe

Outline: 

Exploring US Pollution Data between 2000 and 2016 for trends in four pollutants(CO, NO2, SO2, & O3).

Datasets to be used:

We are using a dataset published in 2016: "U.S. Polltuion Data - Pollution in the U.S. since 2000". We found this extensive csv file from Kaggle.com. In addition whith this dataset we are pulling a population API from Census.gov.

Research Questions:

•	Which seasons causes a spike in pollution? Why? Does it vary across Geographical regions in the US? 

•	Which city has the highest pollution per Capita?

•	Which city has the largest increase in pollution over the past 16 years? The largest decrease? (time-series)

•	Does Oil prices affect Pollution at all?

•	How does major events affect air pollution? 9/11? Hurricane Katrina? Recession 2008? Other natural disasters?

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

-Clean data in csv file to drop any columns with missing fields.
-Parse through data to find cities with highest pollution counts.
-Create time series charts to compare pollution throughout the 16 year period in selected cities.
-Group data to average pollution counts by 4 seasons.
-Create bar charts to compare seasonal figures.
-Select major events that effected pollution in negative and positive ways.
-Compare data with Census API for per Capita pollution averages.
